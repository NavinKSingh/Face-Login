Face Login System
This project implements a Face Login System, allowing users to authenticate themselves using facial recognition. It provides a simple solution to integrate face-based login for applications or web services.

Features
Real-time facial recognition
Face matching for authentication
User registration and face data storage
Secure login using face recognition
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For image processing and real-time facial recognition.
Dlib: For face detection and facial landmarks.
TensorFlow/Keras (optional): For advanced machine learning models.
SQLite (or any database): To store user face data.
Flask/Django (optional): If you want to integrate it with a web application.
Requirements
To run the face login system, youâ€™ll need the following software and libraries:

System Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)
Dlib (for face detection)
SQLite or any other database for storing user data
NumPy and Matplotlib for data handling (optional)
